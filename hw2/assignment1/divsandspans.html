	<div id="description">In HTML4, developers used varieties of HTML tags in order to write their websites. In HTML5, however, the role of various tags in stylizing a webpage has been replaced by CSS. As you will see in this example, different HTML tags are essentially the same as one HTML tag with different visual styles as dictated by the CSS!</div>
