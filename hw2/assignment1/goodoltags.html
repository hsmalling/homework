	<h1>From HTML4 to HTML5</h1>
	<em>How websites' structures changed from 2000s to 2010s</em>
	<hr />
	<p>In HTML4, developers used varieties of HTML tags in order to write their websites. In HTML5, however, the role of various tags in stylizing a webpage has been replaced by CSS. As you will see in this example, different HTML tags are essentially the same as one HTML tag with different visual styles as dictated by the CSS!</p>

	<br>
	<strong>Tags that you can't find often in HTML5</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>Br tags: You can just stack divs with some paddings</li>
		<li>Hr tags: You can just draw a line with a div</li>
		<li>Tables tags: Tables in HTML4 were mostly to create layouts. Now, this role has been replaced by divs.</li>
		<li>Font tags: You can just use font css properties</li>
		<li>Center tags: Some people (including me) miss this tag. But you can essentially center anything with just a few divs and CSS.</li>
	</ol>
